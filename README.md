CarListings
================================

CarListings is a simple Ext JS 4.x application that illustrates the use of data binding. In the finished application, the user selects a car in a grid to see details about the car, including a picture of it. By the end of this tutorial, you should have a better understanding of how to build and configure views, how to model data, and how to bind your data to views.
